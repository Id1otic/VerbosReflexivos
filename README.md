# Spanish Vocabulary Study Website

A web-based study tool I built for my Spanish class to practice and reinforce vocabulary using interactive quizzes.

## Live Demo
View the website here: https://id1otic.github.io/VerbosReflexivos/main.html

## Features
- Interactive vocabulary quizzes
- Immediate feedback on user answers (correct/incorrect)
- Simple, distraction-free interface focused on studying
- Runs entirely in the browser

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Why I Built This
I wanted a more efficient and interactive way to study Spanish vocabulary than traditional flashcards, so I created a website that actively tests recall and reinforces learning.

## What I Learned
- Building interactive websites with JavaScript
- Handling user input and dynamically updating the page
- Structuring a small project from idea to deployment
- Publishing and deploying a site using GitHub Pages

## Future Improvements
I plan to improve this by adding multiple choice problems instead of just typing.
